This folder contains miscellaneous code which I have written.

## Active Reload

Front-end code that requires the player to eject the spent magazine, then insert a new one by reloading at the right time (think Gears Of War, Synthetik, etc.). The "reloading crosshair" follows the aiming crosshair and has a target zone whose size varies on weapon type and whose positioning is randomized on each reload.
